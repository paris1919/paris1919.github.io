			<p> hi, you've reached akash bansal.
				<br><br>

					I write  <a href="https://paris1919.github.io/poetry/flying">poems</a>, make films, performance, sound art, and DJ.
				<br><br> 
					a lot of my art has to do with borders; both real and imagined, between people and places, and especially those within ourselves.
				<br><br>
					if you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an <a href="mailto:akashbansal10@gmail.com">email</a>.
				<br><br>
					while you're here, feel free to take a look around</p>
