			<p> hi, you've reached akash bansal.

					i'm afk rn working away at my keyboard on some new projects, but feel free to write to me about what you're reading about.<br>
					the last great book I read was <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/sabrina">sabrina</a> which i highly recommend you seek out. 
					<br> if you're interested i've left a few <a href="file:///Users/ak/Documents/Web/Personal/Sitemap/poetryab/Poetry/dreams.html">poems</a> here for you to peak at. i also like listening to music and sometimes play it for people at parties<a href=https://soundcloud.com/akash-bansal/beats-united-radio-ft-tender-buttons-11118>DJ</a>.
				<br><br> 
					a lot of my art has to do with borders; both real and imagined, between people and places, and especially those within ourselves.
				<br><br>
					if you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an email.
				<br><br>
					while you're here, feel free to take a look around</p>
