			<pre>
sometimes i dream about kissing boys
plain boys, half-white boys
dressed sometimes in girl's clothing
		
often i dream about getting murdered
usually they are American boys
usually 50s pinup white boys
on occasion lovers, friends or cockroaches
	
sometimes i remember adolescence
boys think my skin is dog shit
					
sometimes i dream about kissing Andy
licking McDs sauce from his lips
	
sometimes i dream about my faggy window
how i'd climb into the alley
	
how'd i'd leap into a new thing

i'm always stuck in dreams
sometimes i wake up and am still in dreams
sometimes i wake up and go back to sleep
usually i'm asleep until the middle of the day
and when i do finally rise, i'm empty
dreaming of a swing, an airplane, a rope
a way out that lets me in
