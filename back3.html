			<p> hi, you've reached akash bansal.
				<br><br>
					i'm afk rn working away at my keyboard on some new projects, but feel free to write to me about what you're reading about.
				<br><br>
					the last great book I read was <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/sabrina">sabrina</a> which i highly recommend you seek out. 
				<br><br> 
					if you're interested i've left a few <a href="https://paris1919.github.io/poetry/flying">poems</a> here for you to peak at. i also like listening to music and sometimes play it for people at bars or parties. Here is some music that I love right <a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/qe8y6095g6u0917g8x9h9xrw5/playlist/4TogiEfSBsVcHU3djDkRpY?si=6TiGG_5gR-ixD1VwVPi7Bw>now</a>.
				<br><br> 
					a lot of my art has to do with borders; both real and imagined, between people and places, and especially those within ourselves.
				<br><br>
